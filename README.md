# The Final Planet - A TFE2 Mod
ok description goes here at some point blah blah flat earth joke blah blah

if you are working on a math heavy piece of the code keep in mind this desmos graph i made a while back: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/iacxamle1r

if you want you can improve or change the calculations to make them simpler or more possible and suggest that and we can change it- i guess my point is the desmos graph here is not definitive, its just the shared thing to use while working on this

## Current Goals/Things To Work On
- planet drawing algorithm (spr_planet_template can be used as placeholder till this is done)
- background drawing recreation
- stage panning and zooming**
- city building ui
- replace the save and load lists with ones specific to planet mod because typical save files simply wont work on circular
- positioning on planets and how will that work**
- citizen physics**
- the actual building/deleting tile system on the planets (pain)**
- building class integration (rather than recreating each building individually, create a wrapper to be used in the planet mod that works for all buildings, dont ask how area/neighbor effects are gonna work)

these are all things that need to be done before its in a decent playable state. this is why i didnt want to do this by myself

\*\* make a plan preferably in a markdown file on how to do this before you get started
